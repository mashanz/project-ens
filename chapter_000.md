# Where am I?

cold, pain, I can't move, where am I?

I am researcher in space industries, I am going to space far away from sun to research about posibility to create sustainable biosphare far uninhabitation environment. 

My mission is to make habitable spaceship for space exploration. and currently A am in asteroid belt in in our solar system.

and another think is to test wrap engine or FTL that recently created and anti gravity shield to avoid object crashing to the spaceship.

I got a lot of supplay and equipment, from quantum computer and entire copy of code repository from opensource project arround the world in film paper that thay claimed to sustaind thousand years.

I also got new material to store entre earth open database and information, in a nutshell, copy of internet from earth.

well may be it a little bit confussing because all of the supplay and equipment most of them are new product and under real world testing stage.

back at the present, while at the asteroid belt we I am testing antigravity shield.

it run smoothly, althought it didn't block like shield, it more like soft shield, so the asteroid slower down and bouncing slowly.

and it have a lot of loop hole? if asteroid too fast, it will hit the ship, or if it too big, the ship will bounching.

after finishing testing the shield, next is testing other equipment

our current maximum space speed technology is HTL (Half Than Light) although my max space ship speed is 3/8, my current speed is 1/8 to 2/8 SoL (Speed of Light) for energy effisiensi

after 6 month of testing and research, finally the last test is FTL engine, the question is why it not tested first in the first place? because because of energy effisiensi, currently it not possible. and my destination is going back to earth, I can borrow sun energy to refill FTL engine because I am going to sun direction.

all check and calculation is fine, all energy collector are deployed, time to warming up the engine, after view minute, eergy filled the minimum bar, so I am exited to test it

here i go,

ftl engine run smoothly but something weired, there some gravity anomaly near the ftl track, it is dark planet, althought it size is around thumb, but if it touch it will suck up entire eifel building and explode.

it is rare to find the dark planet around,

after gradually speedinng near it, i avoid collision. 

and counting down 10 second to ftl engine to burst,

some unexpected happen, there are sun wave.

I hope ftl is activate before it hit, but for the computer calculation it fill hit the same time, 

3 second 2 second 1 second, it so fast that it hit the space ship, and the antigravity activated my ship bounched and flipped back i thought the ftl engine will pass the solar wind but it only burst a moment and stopped, after flipping the ftl re activated and there is blue light like super nove in front of the ship

it is dark planet, it following my ship and got energy from previous burst, and it about to explode, it explode and my ftl engine reacivating, 

lost, i dont remember after that.
